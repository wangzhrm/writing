            <div class="sentence-structure">
                A key similarity is that <strong>(category A)</strong> and <strong>(category B)</strong> both experienced a decline, but the rate of decrease for <strong>(category A)</strong> was much more pronounced.

            <div class="sentence-structure">
                Unlike <strong>(category A)</strong>, which rose steadily, <strong>(category B)</strong> fluctuated significantly over the period.

                One clear outlier is <strong>(category)</strong>, which demonstrated a far more significant <strong>(change)</strong> than any other.

                Unlike the other categories, <strong>(category)</strong> saw a consistent rise throughout the entire period.

                What stands out is that <strong>(category)</strong> did not follow the general trend, instead remaining relatively stable.

            <div class="sentence-structure">
                Notably, the data for <strong>(category)</strong> was unique as it was the only one to show a sharp increase at the very end of the period.

                The growth of <strong>(category)</strong> was slow and steady until <strong>(year)</strong>, when it began to accelerate sharply.

                There was a general downward trend for <strong>(category)</strong>, albeit with some minor fluctuations.

                Following a period of volatility, the figures for <strong>(category)</strong> stabilized in the latter half of the period.

            <div class="sentence-structure">
                The trend for <strong>(category)</strong> was largely consistent over the period, showing a gradual increase without any major drops.

                Although there was an overall increase, the growth for <strong>(category)</strong> slowed down significantly after <strong>(year)</strong>.
